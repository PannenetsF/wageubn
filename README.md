## Notice 

This repo is based on the same framework as [tqt](https://github.com/PannenetsF/TQT) and focuses on inferrence only. Even the quantized error and gradient could be got from `wageubn.function.errorquant` and `wageubn.function.gradquant`, we will not use them. If they are essential for your training, please fork this repo and wrap the `wageubn.function` modules with it.

Now available at [https://pypi.org/project/wageubn/0.1.0/](https://pypi.org/project/wageubn/0.1.0/).

Networks quantized via this package could be find at [https://github.com/PannenetsF/QuantizationPool](https://github.com/PannenetsF/QuantizationPool).

## wageubn's modules

### wageubn.function 

`function` is a re-impletement of `torch.nn.modules`. Besides all the args used in the original function, a quantized function get 2 kind of optional arguments: `bit_width` and `retrain`. 

`bit_width` has 2 type: weight/bias or activation. 

If the `retrain` is `True`, the Module will be in Retrain Mode, with the `log2_t` trainable. Else, in Static Mode, the `log2_t` are determined by initialization and not trainable.

### wageubn.config

Config the bitwidth via `wageubn.config.Config` and `wageubn.config.network_config`. `wageubn.config.Config` is a namedtuple and you can set bitwidth as its key.

With more consideration of hardware implement, the input and output of any module should be FIXED(or quantized). So there is a `iostrict` attribute to do this.

## wageubn's problem 

`iostrict` is one part as stated in [last section](#wageubnconfig). The paper uses `directquant` almost everywhere, which turns to a new problem: the given k is not the bitwidth of data. It's just the width of the decimal. As a result, I decide to add more attribute to control the module's real bitwidth `real_*` for each part.

# Contributing 

It will be great of you to make this project better! There is some ways to contribute!

1. To start with, issues and feature request could let maintainers know what's wrong or anything essential to be added. 
2. If you use the package in you work/repo, just cite the repo and add a dependency note! 
3. You can add some function in `torch.nn` like `HardTanh` and feel free to open a pull request! The code style is simple as [here](style.md).
